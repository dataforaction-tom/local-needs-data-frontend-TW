          NPC local Needs Databank metadata tool Documentation
        </h3>
        <p class="">
          Here you will find documentation about the tool including the data standard. We hope this
          will support you in using the tool effectively to easily upload your data easily <br />

    <h4 class="property-text">What data are we hoping you will provide to the databank?</h4>
    <p>
      We have designed the databank to be flexible in the data you can upload as need can mean
      different things to different people. As such our standard allows you to define what your data
      is related to
    </p>
    <p>
      We have based the databank on the idea of an 'observation' something you have observed that
      might indicate need. For example you may have observed people asking you for support via one
      or more of your services. If this instance you would upload the number of people you have
      supported, and indicate this as a <span class="b dark-pink bg-light-gray">'value'</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside indication the value of your observation, we would ask that you define one or more
      <span class="b purple bg-light-gray">properties</span>, such as where
      <span class="b">(i.e location)</span> this took place, or when,
      <span class="b">(i.e. the time period or date)</span> it took place
    </p>
    <p>
      The metadata tool allows you to add these details to your csv upload, either for the whole
      file or for individual columns
    </p>
    <p>
      We also ask you to add a description of the data and who the pubisher is. In most cases the
      <span class="b">publisher</span> will be your organisation
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Allow users to compare demand in different areas or over diferrent time periods</li>
      <li>Identify areas where demand is higher or lower that the mean</li>

        Indicate areas where other factors, such as funding or deprivation might impact iupon demand
        or capacity
